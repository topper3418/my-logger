make comments able to take links and files and such
Use LLM's to predict the type
use llm to summarize my day
add download logs button
add filter by type button
add edit functionality to the table
make it so TODO's create a separate list, and then we can make "progress" and "complete" and "milestone" types modify them. At first you'd have to select the ID
make a command-line program "log" to compliment this, I can go win+R -> log {logtype} message. It would be really fast
make it so the table scrolls independant of the form
maybe I can make (on click) the type cells turn into dropdowns such that we can just go change it. that would mean we need a "type" table too
across the top, there should be a stacked bar graph for logs per hour broken down by type
when you have the todos across the top, make it so you can click on one of the todos and your log will be attached to it.
this could completely replace the single-task scheduler. I can make it so todo's can be added to the todos and they would show as a tree view at the top, completed todos go away, you can click on a todo to get the logs filtered down for just that one.
I should evolve this such that events are one aspect of the data recorded, but you have a range of statuses you can choose from and those are persistent. you will always have a status.
