# my-logger
a logger for you to easily tag and log generic comments throughout your day


## how it works
### UI
left side of the screen: a text box and a dropdown to select type
right side of the screen: a table of comments, that you can filter
### DB
just one table, for logs
### Router
add log
get logs (start time, end time)
